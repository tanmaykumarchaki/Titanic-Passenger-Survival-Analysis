# Titanic Passenger Survival Analysis

This project analyzes the survival rates of passengers aboard the Titanic using various data visualizations and machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand which factors influenced whether a passenger survived or not, such as age, gender, passenger class, and other characteristics.

## Project Description

This repository contains the analysis of the Titanic dataset, which includes the **survival status** of passengers, along with various attributes like **age, sex, class, fare**, etc. The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, clean it, perform basic analysis, and create visualizations to uncover insights about the survival patterns of passengers.

## Data Overview
